		The goal of this game is to survive as long as you can.
		If any of the enemy touching you, your health will get down.
		You are the white player,and you can move with the arrows.
		Pressing space will trigger a dodge and your player become gray,
		in this state you dont get any damage for less then a second.
		There are green apple that spawn around the screen,
		only when you eat one the other will spawn.
		Every apple you eat will rise your level,
		every 10 levels you will get faster and more durable to touching.
		There are also blue apples.
